# Eurovision voting patterns

In this project I analyse and visualize the development of Eurovision over the years including the expansion of the contest. I also look at more current voting patterns between competing countries: How some countries always vote for each other and others don't.

The result is the article [Our 12 points go to...:](https://laurabejder.com/eurovision/).

### Notebooks
`1_cleaning.ipynb`: In this notebook I clean the data from `votes.csv`. I aggregates the votes and find averages across years and countries. It is all used in the further analysis in `2_analysis.ipynb`.  

`2_analysis.ipynb`: In this notebook I begin the real analysis of the data. The notebook also includes some of the ggplots of data visualizations. They were later edited in Adobe Illustrator.

### Inside the data directory
Inside this directory, you can find all the data used in the analysis.

### Inside the visuals directory
This directory contains the outputs of the ggplots created in 2_analysis.ipynb and the versions edited in Adobe Illustrator.
