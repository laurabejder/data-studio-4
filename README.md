# Eurovision voting patterns

In this project I analyse and visualize the development of Eurovision over the years including the expansion of the contest. I also look at more current voting patterns between competing countries: How some countries always vote for each other and others don't.

The result is the article Medical Knitting: [Our 12 points go to...:](https://laurabejder.com/eurovision/).

## Project description
### Aim of the project
The aim of this project is to examine the use and popularity of the knitted knockers recipes among the ravelry.com users. It looks in to the popularity of the recipes compared to other categories of recipes in the "medical knitting" subcategory, examines the price of a knocker by looking at the recommended yarn and puts the concept into the larger context of high breast cancer rates among women compared to other types of cancer.

### Findings
I found that knitted knockers are the by far most popular category of recipe in the medical knitting subcategory. This is measured by the number of completed projects registred on Ravelry.com.

I also found that knitted knockers are a cheaper alternative to conventional breast prosteses.

### Data collection
The data in `votes.csv` comes from Spijkervet's [Eurovision dataset](https://github.com/Spijkervet/eurovision-dataset).

### Data analysis process

After having collected information on all the recipes in the medical knitting category, I manually categorized all of the recipes. In some categories there were a lot of recipes while other categories only has one or a few recipes. 7 of the recipes did not have a medical purpose, so they were categorized as na. Knitted knockers are the second largest category after heating/cooling bags.
